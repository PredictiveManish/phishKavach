This is a Cyber threat removal project in which you can check out any link is phished or not and in this project the tech stack used in HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Pyscript and some use of Javascript too and I used an algorithm of machine learning known as Logistics regression.
In this project the main thing which is done is that it is a pre trained model which can learn through a dataset of lakhs of links and various things and judge the mistakes and differences between original/authentic or safe things and the embedded/ threat based links or messages.
